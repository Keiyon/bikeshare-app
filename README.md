Instructions
Welcome to Bike W/ Bae!

Upon entering the website, you will notice that a modal has appeared on the screen with a “Find Me!” button and a “Submit” button.

After clicking on the “Find Me!” button, there is a hidden prompt that basically asks you if you want the website to look at your current location.  This will help determine the bikes near you as well as a zoom in of the area around you.  There is also about a 3-4 second delay after clicking on that button for the map to appear in the background.

Now that the modal is gone, the user will notice that there are several blue markers at certain locations of the map. Each marker is an indication for where a bike is located.

When the user clicks on a marker, the marker will have a popup box that will notify the user the:
1) Brand Name
2) Name of station or bike
3) If it’s a CapitalBikeShare, it will tell the user how many bikes are available at the station OR
  if it’s a dockless bike then it will state N/A
